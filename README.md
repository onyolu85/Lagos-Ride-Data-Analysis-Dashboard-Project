## Power BI Dashboard

### Key Features
- **Summary KPIs:** Count of rides, total ride revenue, and filters for Ride ID, Month, and Payment Method.
- **Interactive Charts:**
  - **Distribution of distance per month** – Highlights ride distances trends.
  - **Distribution of estimated minutes per month** – Shows average ride durations.
  - **Distribution of ride price (Naira)** – Displays most common fare ranges.
  - **Distribution of car type** – Comfort, Economy, Premium, Executive.
  - **Distribution of payment method** – Wallet, Card, Cash, Bank Transfer.
  - **Distribution of traffic type** – Moderate, Heavy, Light, Very Heavy.
- **Sidebar Navigation:** Tabs for Dashboard, Customer, Driver, Ride, Map Location, and Table/Tree-Map for easy exploration.

The dashboard allows stakeholders to monitor ride performance, revenue trends, and operational patterns for data-driven decision-making.
